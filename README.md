# React + Vite

This project is an Apple website clone that showcases product interactions and animations. It features auto-sliding videos with a visible timer, a 3D iPhone model (.gbl) that users can rotate with clicks and drag, and options to customize the phoneâ€™s color and size. The project is built with Tailwind CSS for styling, GSAP/React for smooth animations, and Three.js via react-three/fiber and react-three/drei for the 3D experience.
